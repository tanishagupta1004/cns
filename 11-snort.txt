Snort
What is IDS
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is software specifically built to monitor network 
traffic and discover irregularities.
Once suspicious or malicious activity is discovered, an intrusion detection system 
will send an alarm to specified technicians or IT administrators.

Types of IDS
Intrusion detection systems primarily use two key intrusion detection methods: 
signature-based intrusion detection and anomaly-based intrusion detection.

different modes of snort
• Sniffer mode, which simply reads the packets off of the network and displays them for 
you in a continuous stream on the console (screen).
• Packet Logger mode, which logs the packets to disk. packet data and/or headers are 
written to the hard drive of the host on which Snort runs
• Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) mode, which performs detection and 
analysis on network traffic. This is the most complex and configurable mode.

Steps

1. Installing snort conf in IDS mode and writing rules

Use ifconfig to get enp0s3
sudo apt-get install snort
sudo gedit /etc/snort/snort.conf

This will open up a file: ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.44.0/24

2. To validate the changes made in snort.conf file 
sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf enp0s3

3. To set the snort in IDS mode

sudo snort -A console -q -u snort -g snort -c/etc/snort/snort.conf enp0s3
